Description: Implements a procedure for forecasting time series data based on
  an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly and weekly
  seasonality, plus holidays.  It works best with daily periodicity data with
  at least one year of historical data.  Prophet is robust to missing data,
  shifts in the trend, and large outliers.
